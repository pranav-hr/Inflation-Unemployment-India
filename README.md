📘 Project Summary 

This project explores how financial digitalisation, proxied by electronic transaction volume, impacts unemployment and inflation across 22 Indian states from 2014 to 2023. Using panel data econometrics in R, I applied:

* Two-Way Fixed Effects (2FE) to estimate average effects

* Linear Mixed Effects (LME) to capture state-level heterogeneity

* Difference-in-Differences (DiD) to assess causal effects around the 2016 demonetisation policy
  

🔍 Key Findings


Digitalisation is positively associated with unemployment and negatively with inflation on average.

Substantial variation in unemployment effects across states, minimal inflation variation—consistent with the Law of One Price.

DiD estimates suggest economically meaningful but statistically insignificant effects.
