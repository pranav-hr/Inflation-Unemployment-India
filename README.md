📘 Project Summary
This project explores how financial digitalisation, proxied by electronic transaction volume, impacts unemployment and inflation across 22 Indian states from 2014 to 2023. Using panel data econometrics in R, I applied:

Two-Way Fixed Effects (2FE) to estimate average effects

Linear Mixed Effects (LME) to capture state-level heterogeneity

Difference-in-Differences (DiD) to assess causal effects around the 2016 demonetisation policy

🔍 Key Findings
Digitalisation is positively associated with unemployment and negatively with inflation on average.

Substantial variation in unemployment effects across states, minimal inflation variation—consistent with the Law of One Price.

DiD estimates suggest economically meaningful but statistically insignificant effects.

📁 Repository Structure
data/ – Clean panel dataset (monthly, 2014–2023)

code/ – R scripts for analysis and plotting

figures/ – Regression output graphs and maps

output/ – (optional) regression tables and LaTeX exports

Let me know if you want this integrated with LaTeX equations or need help making the repo more visual (e.g., state maps or time-series plots).
